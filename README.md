# NewtonianFractals4Blender WIP
 
#### WARNING: For the addon to work you need to install pillow Python module using teh python.exe file that Blender uses.

The addon still doesn't allow for the changes in fractal properties via the UI. For that you need to edit the python script. Hence it is not advisable to use it.

Here is a couple of examples of usage with the image being used as different maps in the material editor:
